  # Spotify
  
I've made a Spotify-Clone web app using 3rd party API integration, user authentication, Spotify API, responsive design, material UI. It was a fun project to make and I learnt a lot in the process.

# What it does

* With this tool, the user will be able to play songs just like spotify, create playlists, comment on songs etc.
* Includes user authentication, volume controls, and playback history.
* It also has a small feature of previewing songs which allows the user to review a part of the song.


# Built with
* React
  * front-end is built on React.js
* MongoDB
  * to store the user credentials, queries, processed video and other data
* Express
  * used express.js to create an api in order to connect the frontend and the database
* Spotify-API 
  * 3rd party API to handle all the data about the songs and playback.
